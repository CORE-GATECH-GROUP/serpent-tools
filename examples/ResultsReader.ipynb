    "This notebook demonstrates the capabilities of the serpentTools to read Serpent results files. SERPENT [1] produces a result file (i.e. `_res.m`), containing general results (e.g. `k-eff`), metadata (e.g. `title`) and homogenized cross-sections. The homogenized cross-section sets are printed in the results file for all the requested universes. The ResultsReader is capable of reading this file, and storing the data inside univ objects. Each such object has methods and attributes that should ease the analyses."
