These are designed to facilitate the parsing of files with a regular structure.
For example, the depletion files all contain "chunks" of data that are separated
by empty lines. Each chunk leads off with either the name of the material and
associated variable, or the metadata, e.g. ``ZAI``, ``DAYS``. These parsers
help break up these files into more digestible pieces.

.. note::
    
    For developers, it is not required that these classes be used. These are
    bundled with this project to eliminate the need to install extra packages.
    Some of the readers, like the
    :py:class:`~serpentTools.parsers.branching.BranchingReader` are not
    well suited for this type of parsing.

.. currentmodule:: serpentTools.parsers.base

The :class:`CSCStreamProcessor` is provided to help with reading
sparse matrices provided by Serpent. These are current found in the
depletion and fission matrix files.
