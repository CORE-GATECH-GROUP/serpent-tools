.. _project-scope:

Scope
=====

The scope of this project is to simplify and expedite analysis
stemming from ``SERPENT`` outputs. In the future we may expand
this project to expand to interacting heavily with input files,
but that is currently beyond the scope of this project. Any and
all issues, features and pull requests will be examined through
this scope.

.. _issues:

Issues
======

The goal for this project is to become the de facto method for processing
``SERPENT`` outputs and, if you're looking at this, there is some way
we can improve.
The `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/issues>`_
is the preferred way to post bug reports and feature requests.

Bug Reports
-----------

The more information given, the quicker we can reproduce and hopefully
resolve the issue. Please see
`issue-template <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md>`_
for a template that should be used for reporting bugs.
One of the developers will add a
`bug label <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/labels/bug>`_
and start moving to resolve the issue posthaste.

Feature Requests
----------------

We are very interested in adding functionality from the SERPENT community!
Requests can be done through the issue tracker as well.
You can create an issue on the issue tracker with ``[Feature]``  or
``[Request]`` in the title.
Describe what you would like to add, some expected results, and the
purpose behind the feature.
The development team will apply an
`enhancement label <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/labels/enhancement>`_
and proceed accordingly.


Pull Requests
=============

Pull requests are how we review, approve, and incorporate changes into
the ``master`` branch. If you have code you want to
contribute, please look at the content in the :ref:`dev-guide`
for things like :ref:`pr-checklist`, :ref:`code-style`, and more.

When your content is ready for the pull request, follow
the
`pull-request-template <https://github.com/CORE-GATECH-GROUP/serpent-tools/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md>`_
and make a request!
Someone of the core development team will review the changes according
to the criteria above and make changes and/or approve for merging!
