    Anaconda
        Python distrubution that makes installing packages like
        :term:`numpy` easier for Windows. Includes over 700
        packages. For a smaller, more minimal approach, see
        :term:`Miniconda`. For more information, see
        `<https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.

    Anaconda Prompt
        Modified Windows prompt to be used with the :term:`Anaconda` python
        distrubution. Reconfigures python paths to point to packages
        installed via :term:`conda`

    conda
        From `<https://www.conda.io/docs/>`_: 

          Conda is an open source package management system and environment
          management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Lunix. Conda
          quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependncies

    CI
        Continuous integration. Software we utilize to check that pull
        requests don't break the code.

    git
        Distributed version control system. Allows us to test and implement
        new features with ease. For more information, see
        `<https://git-scm.com>`_.

    Jupyter notebook
        Powerful web application used in this project, for examples and
        tutorials containing real python code. From `<https://jupyter.org>`_:

            The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows
            you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations,
            visualizations and narrative text.

    lint
        Bits of potentially erroneous code. Can be identified by a :term:`linter`

    linter
        Program that analyzes source code to check for errors, bugs,
        stylistic issues, and other potential hangups.

    matplotlib
        Primary python package for plotting data. Highly customizable
        and extensible. More information at `<https://matplotlib.org>`_

    Miniconda
        Minimal installer for :term:`conda`. From `<https://conda.io>`_:

            Miniconda is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that only
            includes conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a
            small number of useful packages

    numpy
        Widely-used python package that allows multidimensional arrays
        and linear algebra routines. More information at
        `<https://www.numpy.org>`_
    
    pip
        Recommended tool for installing Python packages. More at
        `<https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_

    pytest
        Fully featured python test runner. More at 
        `<https://pytest.org/en/latest/>`_

    scipy
         Widely-used python package that contains more mathematical support
         and data structures, such as sparse matrices.
         Not required for this package, but allows the
         sparsity of some matrices to be exploited. More information at
         `<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_

    SERPENT
        Monte Carlo particle transport code developed at VTT Technical
        Research Centre of Finland, Ltd [serpent]_. Produces output files
        that can be parsed by this project. More information, including
        distribution and licensing of ``SERPENT`` can be found at
        `<http://montecarlo.vtt.fi>`_. 

    yaml
        Human-readable format used for configuration files in this
        project. For more information, see
        `<https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation>`_
